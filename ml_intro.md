### What is machine learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of arificial intelligence. it focuses mainly on designing of systmes, thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experience which is data in case of machine learning.

### AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

- **AI** is a technique which enables machines to mimic human behaviour.
- **ML** its a subset of AI which deals with extraction of pattern from given data which is helpful i learning and making decisions.
- **Deep Learning** Subset of ML which makes the computation of multi-layer neural newtwork feasible.
